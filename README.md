This Project for the culminating assignment in CHE 120, Computer Literacy and Programming for Chemical Engineers entailed taking a python programmed arcade game and editting the code to create a new game with a different layout, different rules. My groupmates and I accomplished this by turning traditional pacman into a death-run. We changed the layout of the entire map, made the ghosts faster than pacman, and including hiding spots to be used by the player (as the ghosts can only change directions when they reach the end of their paths, not at any point in the middle). The game turned out to be challenging, yet possible to beat, making it quite entertaining, especially with the classic start-up track, and a winner track that are played when you reach the end of the deathrun. 

Note: the audio will only be playble on windows devices, as the library used to play the tracks, winsound, is only compatible with the windows OS, for Non-windows operated devices, use the (Non-Windows).py version
